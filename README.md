# Quick_Service

## Time Spent
Approximately 1hr 45mins

## State Management Approach
I used the GetX state management solution because of it's fast and easy implementation which seems best for this project.
With this State management solution, I could easily seperate my business logic from the UI and making it reactive and easy to maintain.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone repository
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run`
   
## Flutter Version
Flutter 3.27.1 • Dart 3.6.0

## Notes
1. I already used the GetX state management solution on this application before I noticed that it was not part of the listed state management option
2. The approximate time does not include time for research and application setup and on github
3. I used Google to help me solve some issues I faced which are;
   * The selected date functionality
   * An issue with the UI instant reaction (Mutable widgets)
   
## If I Had More Time
1. I would have added the shimmer loader
2. Save bookings to loocal storage
